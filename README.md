# Tenant-SQL-project
â€œI created a tenant database in SQL for a real estate system to manage tenant details. I designed normalized tables, set up relationships using primary and foreign keys, and implemented constraints to ensure data integrity. I generated insights like occupancy rates, price trends . This helped in improving property management decisions.
